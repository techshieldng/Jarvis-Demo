Jarvis-Demo
===========

An interactive web app inspired by iron man's j.a.r.v.i.s. This javascript application is inspired by the j.a.r.v.i.s,  tony stark’s artificially intelligent computer system.

This was a personal project to create an interactive application to showcase my work in second semester of college.

It is coded in javascript using various available libraries for animations and effects.

it is unlocked by a voice command taking leverage of Chrome’s inbuilt voice recognition.
